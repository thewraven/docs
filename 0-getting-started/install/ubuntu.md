# With binaries #

We provide binaries for both 32-bit and 64-bit Ubuntu Precise and above (>= 12.04).

To install the server, you have to add the [RethinkDB
repository](http://download.rethinkdb.com/apt) to your list of
repositories and install via `apt-get`.
To do this, paste the
following lines into your terminal:

```bash
source /etc/lsb-release && echo "deb http://download.rethinkdb.com/apt $DISTRIB_CODENAME main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rethinkdb.list
wget -qO- https://download.rethinkdb.com/apt/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rethinkdb
```

If you followed the above instructions before July 2017 and want to upgrade to a newer version of RethinkDB, you will need to first download the new key (0742918E5C8DA04A):

```
$ wget -qO- https://download.rethinkdb.com/apt/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -v -"
```
